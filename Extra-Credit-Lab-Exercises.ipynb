You're going to make a program that prompts for a filename. If the file exists, quit the program! Don't print anything out, don't do anything with the file, don't do anything. Just quit. If the file *doesn't* exist, complain, and prompt the user for a filename again. Do this until the user gives you a valid filename or pours water on their computer in frustration. (Just kidding. Don't pour water on your computer.)\n\nYou're going to want to put the filename prompt inside a loop, so you can ask the user for a filename as many times as you want. But what kind of loop?
